The dataset is taken from the UCI repository (Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science)

********************************************************************************
NOTE: For the project the classes have been binarized - Feature 12 is simply 0 (low quality, <= 5) or 1 (high quality, >= 7).
To simplify the problem, wines with quality 6 have been removed. Red and white wines have been merged into a single dataset

Data Set Information:

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.


Attribute Information:
