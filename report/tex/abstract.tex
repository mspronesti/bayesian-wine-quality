    \noindent This report provides an analysis of the effectiveness of different classification approaches applied to the popular wine quality prediction problem on the wine dataset from the UCI repository. Specifically, the goal is to predict whether the wine has a good or a bad quality. The original dataset consists of 10 classes. Nevertheless, for this work, the dataset has been binarized, collecting all wines with low quality (lower than 6) into class 0, and good quality (greater than 6) into class 1, while those with quality 6 have been discarded.
    In addition, the dataset contains both red and white wines (merged for the sake of this analysis). There are 11 features, that represent physical properties of the wine, with partially balanced classes.
