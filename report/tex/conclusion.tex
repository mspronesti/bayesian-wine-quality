\section{Conclusion}
In this work we analyzed the UCI Wine Quality Dataset applying a set of "traditional" Machine Learning Models and using the minum detection cost function and its derivatives as metrics. We showed how linear models are not very well suited for classifying wine features and how other type of space transformations adapt better to the data. We eventually explored the benefits of combining the most performing models and proved how our approach is effective on test data, yielding results comparable to the expected ones in light of the analysis conducted towards model selection and tuning.
