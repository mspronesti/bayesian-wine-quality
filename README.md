# ScratchML

ScratchML is a python library implementing 
from scratch machine learning algorithms, developed
for 01URTOV
(Machine Learning Pattern Recognition) at PoliTO for 
the laboratory activities and the final project (yeah, no `sklearn` :cry: ).

Feel free to use it for the final project if you're attending
the same class!

## Installation
You can install it via pip running

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mspronesti/scratchml
