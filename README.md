# Wine Quality Classification
Final project for Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition class at Politecnico di Torino (PoliTO).

## Short Description

This project consists in discriminating between good and bad quality wines using the popular wine dataset from the UCI repository.

The original dataset consists of 10 classes (quality 1 to 10). For the project, the dataset has been binarized, collecting all
wines with low quality (lower than 6) into class 0, and good quality (greater than 6) into class 1. Wines with quality 6 have been discarded to simplify the task

The dataset contains both red and white wines (originally separated, they have been merged).  There are 11 features, that represent physical properties of the
wine. Classes are partially balanced.
